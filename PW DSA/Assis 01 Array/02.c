
// ðŸ’¡ **Q2.** Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.
// Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:

// - Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
// - Return k.

// **Example :**
// Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
// Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_*,_*]

// **Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores)[
