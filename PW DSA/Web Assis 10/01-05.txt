1 Middlewares in Node.js are functions that intercept and process HTTP requests and responses. They sit in between the client and the server and can perform various tasks such as request parsing, authentication, logging, error handling, and more. Middlewares are executed sequentially, allowing for modular and reusable code.

2 Express is a web application framework built on top of Node.js. It provides a simpler and more organized way to handle HTTP requests, routing, middleware handling, and other common web development tasks compared to using plain Node.js. Express abstracts away many low-level details, making development faster and more efficient.

3 REST (Representational State Transfer) APIs are a set of principles and conventions for building web services that follow a client-server architecture. REST APIs use standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to perform operations on resources identified by URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). They are stateless and provide a uniform and scalable approach to building web APIs.

4 MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents called BSON (Binary JSON). It is known for its scalability, flexibility, and ease of use. MongoDB is used to handle large volumes of unstructured and semi-structured data, making it suitable for various applications, including web and mobile app development.
5 Mongoose is an Object-Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB in Node.js. It provides a higher-level abstraction and a more intuitive way to interact with MongoDB by defining schemas, models, and performing database operations. Mongoose simplifies the data modeling process, enforces data validation, and offers convenient features like schema-based migrations, middleware support, and query building.
