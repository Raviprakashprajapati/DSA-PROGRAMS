    Q.1 What's Box Model in CSS?
The Box Model in CSS is a concept that describes how elements are structured and displayed on a web page. It consists of content, padding, border, and margin. These components define the total size and spacing of an element.

 Q.2 What are the Different Types of Selectors in CSS & what are the advantages of them?
CSS has various selectors, including element selectors, class selectors, ID selectors, attribute selectors, pseudo-classes, and pseudo-elements. Each selector allows you to target specific elements or groups of elements, enabling precise styling and layout control.

 Q.3 What is VW/VH?
VW (Viewport Width) and VH (Viewport Height) are CSS units relative to the size of the browser window. VW represents a percentage of the viewport width, while VH represents a percentage of the viewport height. These units are useful for creating responsive designs.

 Q.4 What's the difference between Inline, Inline Block, and Block?
Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up the space necessary for their content. Block elements start on a new line and occupy the full width available. Inline-block elements are similar to inline elements but can have a specified width and height, and they start on a new line.

 Q.5 How is Border-box different from Content Box?
In CSS, the default box-sizing property value is "content-box," which includes only the content area within the specified width and height. However, when using "border-box" as the box-sizing value, the specified width and height include the content, padding, and border, making it easier to manage element sizing.

 Q.6 What's z-index and how does it function?
z-index is a CSS property that controls the vertical stacking order of elements on a web page. It specifies the z-axis position of an element relative to other elements. Elements with a higher z-index value are displayed on top of elements with a lower value, allowing you to control the layering of elements.

 Q.7 What's the difference between Grid and Flex?
CSS Grid is a layout system that allows you to create two-dimensional grid layouts with rows and columns. It is ideal for designing complex, grid-based layouts. Flexbox, on the other hand, is a one-dimensional layout system that excels at aligning and distributing elements within a container, either horizontally or vertically. It is suitable for building flexible and responsive single-direction layouts.

 Q.8 Difference between absolute, relative, sticky, and fixed position:

Absolute position: The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor. If no ancestor is positioned, it's positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the document body).
Relative position: The element is positioned relative to its normal position. It still occupies space in the document flow, and other elements respect its position.
Sticky position: The element is positioned based on the user's scroll position. It acts like a combination of relative and fixed position. It remains in the normal flow until a specified scroll threshold is reached, after which it becomes fixed.
Fixed position: The element is positioned relative to the browser window. It stays fixed in its position, even if the page is scrolled. It does not affect the position of other elements.
